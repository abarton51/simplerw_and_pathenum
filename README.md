# Simple Random Walks and Path Enumeration
A project paper I wrote for MATH 3235 Probability Theory at Georgia Tech on simple random walks and path enumeration techniques.

The purpose of the paper was to explore paths from a probabilistic and combinatorial approach. I decided to focus specifically on Dyck path enumeration for studying simple random walks under the symmetric case because of their simple nature and focus on the method of multi-variate generating functions in order to enumerate various statistics on paths.
