# Simple Random Walks and Path Enumeration
A short paper I wrote for MATH 3235 Probability Theory at Georgia Tech on simple random walks and path enumeration techniques.

The purpose of the paper was to explore paths from a probabilistic and combinatorial approach. I decided to focus specifically on Dyck path enumeration for studying simple random walks under the symmetric case because of their simple nature and focus on enumeration technqiue of multi-variate generating functions.
